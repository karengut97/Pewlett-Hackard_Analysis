# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
As Pewlett-Packard prepares for their future, the reality of retirements is becoming a significant concern. An analysis needs to be done to determine the the business impacts of employees retiring.

* Identify the departments at the highest risk.
* Determine how many employees are retirement eligible.
* Identify employees to be mentored by more tenured employees to ensure knowledge transfer.
* Identify gaps where accelerated training needs to take place.


## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Considering Pewlett-Hackard's total employee count is 300,024 but it is not enough to overcome employees retiring.
