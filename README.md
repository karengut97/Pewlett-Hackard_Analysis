# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
As Pewlett-Packard prepares for their future, the reality of retirements is becoming a significant concern. An analysis needs to be done to determine the the business impacts of employees retiring.

* Identify the departments at the highest risk.
* Determine how many employees are retirement eligible.
* Identify employees to be mentored by more tenured employees to ensure knowledge transfer.
* Identify gaps where accelerated training needs to take place.


## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Considering Pewlett-Hackard's total employee count is 300,024 but it is not enough to overcome employees retiring.

## Summary: 

As stated above, the current count of retirement eligible employees is **90,398**. Pewlett-Hackard will need to hire 88,847 employees to fill the gap should all retirement eligible employees actually decide to retire. The current profile for those employees is provided here:

While some current employees have been identified as suitable mentees, the gap remains significant. The follow table demonstrates remaining needs for each job title function:
