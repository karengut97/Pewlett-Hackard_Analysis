## Recommendations
1. It will be prudent to continue to reach into the employee population and identify additional mentees, based on skill set and not birth year. 
2. A hiring task force could be formed to launch a hiring campaign and provide a pipeline for the company.
3. An incentive plan for retirement eligible employees to mentor others could offset a massive exit and impact to the business.
