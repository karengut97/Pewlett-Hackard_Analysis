# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
As Pewlett-Packard prepares for their future, the reality of retirements is becoming a significant concern. An analysis needs to be done to determine the the business impacts of employees retiring.

* Identify the departments at the highest risk.
* Determine how many employees are retirement eligible.
* Identify employees to be mentored by more tenured employees to ensure knowledge transfer.
* Identify gaps where accelerated training needs to take place.


## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Considering Pewlett-Hackard's total employee count is 300,024 but it is not enough to overcome employees retiring. 
* As it stands today,  30% of Pewlett-Hackard's employees are retirement eligible based upon employees born between January, 1952 through month end December, 1995.
* Employees born in 1965 have been identified as the ideal group for mentoring/knowledge transfer. This group represents 0.05% of the employee population.
* Senior level jobs (Senior Engineer and Senior Staff) make up 64% of the entire retirement eligible group.
*
